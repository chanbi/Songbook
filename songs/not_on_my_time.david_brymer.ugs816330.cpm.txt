{comment: Verse}
The an[Db]guish of my soul is when I see how far I fell from loving [Ebm]You, my L[F7]ord
And the pl[Bbm]ace that I once knew with You is ov[Db]ergrown and left alone, but [E]You are still th[Gb]ere

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
              Ab                      Dbsus Db
And then I realized You were not in a hurry
You were taking Your time to make me more like You
And there I k[Bbm]new that You were a[Ebm]ble to perfect the [Db]work You started in [Ab]me

{start_of_chorus}
{comment: Chorus}
SO K[Db]EEP ME CLOSE TO YOU – NOT ON MY TIME, BUT ON Y[Bbm]OURS
CAUSE I WANNA BE W[Gb]ITH YOU WHERE YOU ARE
K[Db]EEP ME CLOSE TO YOU – NOT ON MY TIME, BUT ON Y[Bbm]OURS
CAUSE [Db]ALL THAT I W[Ab]ANT IS Y[Db]OU
