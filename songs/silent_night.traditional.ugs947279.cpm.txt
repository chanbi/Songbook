[A]Silent night!  Holy night!
[E]All is calm, [A]all is bright
[D]Round yon Virgin, [A]Mother and Child!
[D]Holy infant, so [A]tender and mild,
[E]Sleep in heavenly [A]pe - [F#m7]ace,
[A]Sleep in [E]heavenly [A]peace.

{comment: Verse 2}
Silent night!  Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from heaven afar,
Heavn'ly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ, the Saviour, is born!
Christ, the Saviour, is born!

{comment: Verse 3}
Silent night!  Holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth!
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth!
