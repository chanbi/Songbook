{comment: Intro}
[D] [Bm9] [F#m] [G] 

{comment: Verse 1}
[D]Your love is devoted[Em], like a ring of solid [G]gold
Like a vow that is tested[F#m], like a [A]covenant of old                         
[D]Your love is enduring[Em], through the winter [G]rain  
And beyond the horizon[F#m], with [A]mercy for today

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[G]Faithful You have [D]been, and faithful you will [A]be
You pledge yourself to [Em]me, and it’s why I sing

{start_of_chorus}
{comment: Chorus}                    
Your pra[G]ise will ever be on my [D]lips, ever be on my lips          
Your pra[Bm]ise will ever be on my [A]lips, ever be on my lips
{end_of_chorus}

{comment: Verse 2}
You Father the orphan, your kindness makes us whole
You shoulder our weakness, and Your strength becomes our own
You’re making me like you, clothing me in white
Bringing beauty from ashes, for You will have Your bride

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
Free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame
And known by her true name, and it’s why I sing

{comment: Bridge}
[D]You will be praised, [A]You will be praised
[Bm]With angels and saints we sing [G]worthy are You Lord 
[D]You will be praised, [Em]You will be praised
[Bm]With angels and saints we sing [G]worthy are You Lord
