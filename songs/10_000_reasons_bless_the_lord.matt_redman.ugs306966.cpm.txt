{comment: Verse 1}
The [C]sun comes [G]up, it's a [D]new day [Em]dawning;
It's [C]time to [G]sing Your [D]song aga[Em]in.
What[C]ever may [G]pass, and what[D]ever lies be[Em]fore me,
[C]    Let me be [G]singing when the [Dsus4]even--[D]ing [G]com[Gsus4]es.      [G] 

{comment: Verse 2}
You're [C]rich in [G]love, and You're [D]slow to [Em]anger.
Your [C]name is [G]great, and Your [D]heart is ki[Em]nd.
For [C]all Your [G]goodness, I will [D]keep on [Em]singing;
[C]    Ten thousand [G]reasons for my [Dsus4]heart  [D]to [G]find.[Gsus4]      [G] 
 
{comment: Verse 3}
And [C]on that [G]day when my [D]strength is [Em]failing,
The [C]end draws [G]near, and my [D]time has co[Em]me;
[C]Still my [G]soul will sing Your [D]praise un[Em]ending:
[C]    Ten thousand [G]years and then for[Dsus4]e-------[D]ver[G]mor[Gsus4]e!       [G]
