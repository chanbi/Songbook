[Em]O Come, O Come, Em[Am]manu[Em]el
[D]And [G]ransom captive [Am]Isra[Em]el
That [Am]mourns in lonely [Em]exile [D]here
Until the [G]Son of [Am]God app[Em]ear
[D]Re[G]joice! [D]Re[Em]joice!
Em[Am]manu[Em]el [D]shall [G]come to thee, O [Am]Isra[Em]el!

{comment: Verse 2}
O come, thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of hell thy people save
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel!

{comment: Verse 3}
O come, thou Day-spring from on high
And cheer us by thy drawing nigh
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadow put to flight
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel!

{comment: Verse 4}
O come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind
Bid thou our sad divisions cease
And be thyself our King of Peace
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel!
