I've got the [G]joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
[D7]Down in my heart, [G]down in my heart
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart
[D7]Down in my heart to [G]stay

{comment: Subsequent lyrics include}
I've got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart...
I've got the far out faith that freaks out farmers down in my heart...
I've got the glorious hope of my blessed redeemer way down in the depths of my heart...
I've got the mighty Messiah that manifests miracles down in the depths of my heart...
Well, if the devil doesn't like it he can sit on a tack...
I've got the love of Jesus Christ my savior down in my heart...
I've got the wonderful love of my blessed redeemer way down in the depths of my heart...
I've got the brightest light in the depths of my heart...
I've got the infinite love of the living lord down in the depths of my heart...
I've got the love of Jesus, love of Jesus down in my heart...
There is therefore now no condemnation down in my heart...
