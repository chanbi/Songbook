Oh [C]Lord, You’re [F]beau[C/E]ti[G]ful
Your [C]face is [F]all [C/E]I [G]see
And [Am]when Your [E]eyes are [F]on [G]this [C]child
Your [Dm7]grace [G]abounds to [C]me

{comment: Verse 2}
Oh Lord, please light the fire
That once burned bright and clear
Replace the lamp of my first love
That burns with Holy fear

{comment: Chorus}
I want to [F]take [C/E]Your [Dm7]word [C]and [G]shine it all [C]around
But first help me [F]just to [Am]live it [G]Lord
And when I’m [F]doing [C/E]well [Dm7]help [C]me
To [G]never seek a [C]crown
For my [F]reward is [C/E]giving [Dm]glory [G]to [C]You
