{comment: Verse 1}
[D]When the music [A]fades, and all is stripped [Em]away
And I simply [A]come
[D]Longing just to [A]bring something that's of [Em]worth
That will bless your [A]heart

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
[Em]I'll bring you [D/F#]more than a [A]song, for a song in [Em]itself
Is not what [D/F#]you have requ[A]ired [A/C#][D]
[Em]You search much [D/F#]deeper with[A]in, than the way things [Em]appear
You're looking [D/F#]into my [A]heart

{soc}
{comment: Chorus}
[D]I'm coming back to the [A/C#]heart of worship
And it's [Em]all about you, [G]all about [A]you, [D]Jesus
[D]I'm sorry, Lord, for the [A/C#]things I've made it
When it's [Em]all about you, [G]all about [A]you, [D]Jesus 
{eoc}

{comment: Verse 2}
King of endless worth, no one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours
Every single breath
