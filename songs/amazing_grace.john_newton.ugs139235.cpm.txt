{comment: Verse 1}
A[C]mazing Grace, how [F]sweet the [C]sound,
That saved a wretch like [G7]me.
I [C]once was lost but [F]now am [C]found,
Was blind, but [G7]now I [C]see.

{comment: Verse 2}
[C]T'was Grace that taught my [F]heart to [C]fear.
And Grace, my fears re[G7]lieved.
How [C]precious did that [F]Grace ap[C]pear
The hour I [G7]first be[C]lieved.

{comment: Verse 3}
[C]Through many dangers, [F]toils and [C]snares
I have already [G7]come;
'Tis [C]Grace that brought me [F]safe thus [C]far
and Grace will [G7]lead me [C]home.

{comment: Verse 4}
The [C]Lord has promised [F]good to [C]me.
His word my hope se[G7]cures.
He [C]will my shield and [F]portion [C]be,
As long as [G7]life en[C]dures.

{comment: Verse 5}
[C]Yea, when this flesh and [F]heart shall [C]fail,
And mortal life shall [G7]cease,
I [C]shall possess with[F]in the [C]veil,  
A life of [G7]joy and [C]peace.

{comment: Verse 6}
[C]When we've been here ten [F]thousand [C]years
Bright shining as the [G7]sun.
[C]We've no less days to [F]sing God's [C]praise
Than when we've [G7]first be[C]gun.
